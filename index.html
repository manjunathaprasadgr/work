    <h1>SOME GOOD THINGS FOR YOU</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Hii mother father,I'm a good man im here to explaine how life fucks us all and sollution for this</h2>
    <h3>Nobody dies as a virgin B'couse Life fucks us all.<br> _by motivation manja </h3>
    <p>We all have things we hope for. Some hope for success. Some hope for a second chance. Some merely hope to have food on the table. No matter our circumstances, we all hope for a better life. But before we can build a strong sense of hope, we have to
        have a solid foundation. Manson takes the reader on a tour of all things “hope.” Where it comes from, how we build it, how we lose it, and of course, all the while acknowledging that our existence means nothing—which is why we need hope in the
        first place. The following are three practical ideas that shed light on how we currently view the world concerning hope. </p>
    <p> The truth is that we need more than willpower or over-exaggerated reasoning to achieve real self-control. Our brains are separated into two parts with respect to consciousness: the thinking brain and the feeling brain. The thinking brain is objective
        and factual, while the feeling brain is subjective and relative. To make effective decisions across the board, we must utilize both aspects of conscious thinking. Otherwise, we’d be ridiculously cold and calculated with rationality, or an emotional
        train wreck that ignores objective truth and indulges every impulsive desire. Manson’s concept of the Classic Assumption rings true in all of our lives. All of us—Stoics, philosophers, self-help seekers, and regular folks—have misunderstood what
        our emotions can do for us. We’ve all been caught up in the battle between the thinking brain and the feeling brain. While logical reasoning certainly has its value in some parts of every decision, it cannot be 100% relied upon for every single
        decision. There’s a reason why feeling emotion has survived thousands of years of evolution and natural selection. It’s because we need it. We can’t successfully interact with others or live meaningful lives without the ability to feel. </p>

    <p>So, where does hope come in? Hopelessness is the result of an uneducated feeling brain that has adopted and accepted poor value judgments about itself and the world, Manson writes. Put simply, somewhere along the line, in the trenches of life, something
        horrible happened to us. It robbed us of hope. And while we may have been entirely justified in losing hope, we failed to recognize that those experiences are still robbing us.</p>
    <h2>Success is not a short story. Everybody is willing to be successful. </h2>
    <p>We all desire to live a comfortable existence; with a big beautiful house, a nice car, a fat bank account, etc., etc.</p>
